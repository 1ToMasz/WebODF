== walking over a split text node ==
walking over a split text node lets the avatar disappear.
the textnode split happened when removing an avatar. a fix for
that split is incoming...
but the walking should be more robust and able to cope with such
situations.

1) start cloudoffice/server
2) connect with browser window A) to
   http://localhost:12345/webodf/collabtest/test.html
3) wait at least 1 second and connect browser window B) to same URL
   [A) will show 2 avatars, B) will show one]

4) in B) click on second line on first word ("embedded")
5) in A) click on word "and"
6) still in A) use right-arrow to move the cursor into next word "webmail"

observation: entering "webmail" will take one additional step because of
the text:span element. that is fine[1], but: depending on the position
of the other avatar you will see the webmail-entering-avatar to jump
to a different/incorrect position (end of previous span)

	case A-avatar in word "embedded" [according to step 4)]:
		B-avatar jumps
	case A-avatar in word "intranet" in another span
		B-avatar does not jump when entering "webmail"
	case A-avatar is behind B-avatar (e.g. same line word "browsers")
		B-avatar does not jump

	conclusion:
		when A-avatar is in a text-node on the same level and before
		B-avatar, B-avatar will show strange walking-positions on 
		left-sides of spans.
		when A-avatar is inside a span, the strange behaviour happens
		when B-avatar enters that span from the right side.

guess for reason:
A-avatar splits a text node before B-avatar into two. that confuses the
counting mechanism


[1] perhaps not 100% fine, but it's out of scope of this issue-report
